# Cluster analysis

This repository is a collection of image analysis tools for our 2021 paper
on single-particle analysis of IRE1 clusters. Every plot in the paper can be
reproduced with the included code, and this readme file contains step-by-step
instructions for doing so. Generally, each analysis segment is split into two
parts:
1) Primary image analysis in ImageJ using the TrackMate plugin.
2) Secondary analysis of the processed data in Python (using Jupyter notebooks).
   This is the step that generates all the final plots.

### Software versions used
The code has been explicitly tested with the software versions indicated below.
Small code modifications may or may not be required to run it on your machine if
your software versions differ from the ones listed here.

Operating systems: tested on macOS High Sierra and MS Windows 10.
- Python: Version 3.5.6 (Anaconda dist.). https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
- Seaborn (for data visualization): Version 0.9.0. https://seaborn.pydata.org/
- ImageJ: Version 1.52p (Fiji distribution). https://fiji.sc/
- TrackMate ImageJ plugin: Version 4.0.1. https://imagej.net/TrackMate/


### Project organization
The repository is organized into the following top-level folders:
1) data (all source data, in 'raw' and 'processed' subfolders)
2) imagej_scripts (all ImageJ macros and scripts)
3) notebooks (a single Jupyter [IPython] notebook)
4) reports (all output figures generated by the Jupyter notebook)
5) src (source Python files containing the bulk of the analysis functions)

### Notes
- The script "plotting_settings.py" in the "src" folder is called at the
beginning of the Jupyter notebook to set a uniform plot style. Feel free to make
changes to this file to modify all your plots in a consistent manner.
- I have attempted to make the code reasonably well-documented and organized. It
is my hope that a basic working knowledge of Python and Pandas (which is
included in the Anaconda distribution) will allow you to quickly start making
changes to make the analysis fit your specific needs.
- If you find errors in the code or write additional code that you think would
be useful to contribute to this repository, either raise an issue on Github or
contact me on the Image.sc forum (https://forum.image.sc/). I will do my best to
respond as quickly as possible. My username on both resources is "TheTrappist".

Thank you, and hope this helps!
